Blog Website with CRUD Operations

Feb 2024 - Feb 2024

During this period, I developed a comprehensive blog website leveraging the power of the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This project features distinct admin and user panels, ensuring seamless and intuitive content management.

Key highlights of the project include:

Dynamic User Interface: Designed a responsive and visually appealing UI that enhances user experience.
Efficient Backend Operations: Implemented robust backend functionality to ensure smooth and efficient operations.
Seamless Content Management: Developed separate admin and user panels to simplify content management and provide better control over the website's content.
CRUD Operations: Successfully implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage blog posts, ensuring a fully functional and interactive website.
This project underscores my ability to create user-friendly web applications with strong back-end support, dynamic front-end experience, and complete CRUD functionality.
