Blog Website with CRUD Operations

Feb 2024 - Feb 2024

During this period, I developed a comprehensive blog website leveraging the power of the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This project features distinct admin and user panels, ensuring seamless and intuitive content management.

Key highlights of the project include:

Dynamic User Interface: Designed a responsive and visually appealing UI that enhances user experience.
Efficient Backend Operations: Implemented robust backend functionality to ensure smooth and efficient operations.
Seamless Content Management: Developed separate admin and user panels to simplify content management and provide better control over the website's content.
CRUD Operations: Successfully implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage blog posts, ensuring a fully functional and interactive website.
This project underscores my ability to create user-friendly web applications with strong back-end support, dynamic front-end experience, and complete CRUD functionality.
